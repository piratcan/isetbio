%   absorptions = coneAdaptation(typeAdapt,volts,sensor,species)
%
% Implement adaptation models to produce the cone volts.  The properties of
% the sensor and the type of species are additional parameters.  Not sure
% they should be separated out this way.
%
% The adaptation serves two main goals.  First, the mean level is
% determined as a reference so that increments and decrements are
% meaningful. This is needed so that on- and off-cells can work.  When we
% have a cone absorption that is above the mean, this should cause an
% off-cell to reduce its firing rate and on-cell to increase.  Conversely,
% cone absorptions below the mean cause an on-cell to decrease and an
% off-cell to increase.  By setting a 0 level at the mean, the cones signal
% to the RGCs.  (This text sucks.  Make it better).
%
% See the discussion in Rodieck p. 177 and thereabouts for ideas about cone
% signals.  The physiological question is what is the meaning of the offset
% or zero mean?  Rodieck describes the effect of light as setting the mean
% transmitter release.  In the dark, there is a relatively large dynamic
% range. As the light is on steadily, the release decreases and the range
% available for another flash also decreases.   If you darken from the
% mean, however, the rate can increase.
%
% The way in which the mean is set must depend on a combination of the
% photoisomerizations and the recycling rate, probably through some
% equilibrium equation.  The recycling rate depends on the isomerization
% rate and they set an equilibrium that is slower and slower as the mean
% background gets brighter.  This is how the value of the offset gets set.
%
% In addition to Rodieck's discussion, there are famous papers by Boynton
% and others at SRI expressing such a model based on cone ERPs, and
% probably Rushton and others (van Norren?).
%
% The other issue is the total gain.  The cones can only modulate over a
% dynamic range around the mean.  So, we set the gain as well to keep the
% modulation within some range, such as +/- 50 mV of the mean.
%
% The third issue is whether all the cones are the same, or there is
% space-variant adaptation.  That is for the future.
%
% Inputs
%  typeAdapt:  The adaptation model
%   typeAdapt= 0 - no adaptation
%   typeAdapt= 1 - a single gain map for the whole cone array
%   typeAdapt= 2 - one gain map computed for each cone class
%   typeAdapt= 3 - cone by cone adaptation (NYI)
%
%  volts:      These are a 3D array of coneMosaic x nTimeSamples.
%  sensor:     This is returned with the mean voltage.
%  species:    Normally 'human', but we are experimenting with 'mouse'.
%
% Returns
%  absorptions: A structure containing the adapted data used by the RGC
%  calculations.  Information is added to the structure in the calling
%  routine (coneAbsorptionsTS).
%   .data = the adapted volts
%   .sensor = save the sensor here
%   .unadapteddata = volts;
%   .gain = the effective adaptation gain
%
%
% ALERT:  The amount of adaptation is hard coded at this moment.  It should
% be a parameter somewhere.  Worse yet, the amount of adaptation differs
% between types 1 and 2. Fix this.
%
% In the future, we will look at the time series and have a time-varying
% adaptation function.
