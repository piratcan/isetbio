%   Incorporate external sensor data into the ISET pipeline
%
% This script illustrates  
%
% There are two steps to the process.  First, you establish the sensor
% parameters for the device under test.  This needs to be done only once.
% Then, you read a Matlab file containing the  sensor data and store it in
% the sensor structure.  This is done for each data set.
%
% After reading in the data, you can experiment with the image processing
% pipeline and use the ISET image evaluation tools.

%Initiate a sensor structure.  We use this structure to characterize the
% device under test (dut).  We  do this by creating a default sensor and
% then setting its properties to match the dut.
dut = sensorCreate;
dut = sensorSet(dut,'name','My Sensor');

% Each object represents wavelength sampling of various elements (filters,
% photodetector, so forth).  This information is stored in wave slot of the
% object. This slot lists the wavelength sample values in nanometers
%   
wave = 400:10:700;
dut = sensorSet(dut,'wave',wave);

% For a sensor, the color and infrared filter transmissivities are stored in dut.color
%
%  dut.color.filterSpectra --  a matrix, nWaveSamples x nColorFilters, whose columns 
%    define the filter wavelength tranmissivities
%  dut.color.filterNames   --  a cell array with nColorFilters names
%    indicating the character of the filters.  The first character
%    of the filterName should be 'r','g','b','c','y','m'
%  dut.color.irFilter      -- a vector with nWaveSamples that defines the infrared
%    transmissivity.  This is usually initialized to all 1's, but many
%    cameras use infrared filters and this parameter may be important. 
%  
% To read the color filter data, you must have a spectral file that
% contains the information.  The file should be in the format defined by
% ieSaveSpectralFile.  
%
%% Read the default RGB color filters in the ISET directory.  
% You will want to read your own data.
fname = fullfile(isetRootPath,'data','sensor','colorfilters','RGB.mat');
colorFilters = ieReadSpectra(fname,wave);
dut = sensorSet(dut,'colorFilters',colorFilters);

%% Now read an infrared filter
fname = fullfile(isetRootPath,'data','sensor','irfilters','infrared2.mat');
irFilter = ieReadSpectra(fname,wave);
dut = sensorSet(dut,'irFilter',irFilter);

%% We define the spatial configuration of the color filters.

% Information about the color filter array is stored in the structure
% dut.cfa.  The color filter array is assumed to be described by a unit
% block that describes the arrangement and positions of the color filters.
%
% The dut.cfa has two variables.  
%  
% dut.cfa.pattern  -- A vector that lists the order of the color filters in
%   the block, and
% dut.cfa.unitBlock -- A structure that contains the number of rows and
%   columns in the block as well as a matrix, config, that describes the
%   spatial arrangement of the block
%
cfaPattern = [2 1 ; 3 2];        % A green, red; blue green array

% Usually, the spatial unit block has a position that corresponds to the
% size of the pixel.  In the default case, we have an 8 micron pixel.  So,
% the spatial arrangement below has four pixels separated by 8 microns in
% the row and column dimensions.
% unitBlock.nRows  = 2;
% unitBlock.nCols  = 2;
% pixelSize = 8*1e-6;
% unitBlock.config = [0 0; 0 pixelSize; pixelSize 0; pixelSize pixelSize];  

dut = sensorSet(dut,'cfapattern',cfaPattern);
% dut = sensorSet(dut,'cfaunitblock',unitBlock);
dut = sensorSet(dut,'size',[144 176]);

%% Set the pixel properties.
pixel = sensorGet(dut,'pixel');
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'name','My Pixel');

pixelSize = 6e-6;   % Six micron, the default photodetector has a 50 percent fill factor
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'size constant fill factor',[pixelSize,pixelSize]);

% Many other pixel parameters can be set (see pixelSet).  Here are a few
% examples.
fname = fullfile(isetRootPath,'data','sensor','photodetectors','photodetector.mat');
pixelSpectralQE = ieReadSpectra(fname,wave);
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'spectralQE',pixelSpectralQE);
pixel = pixelSet(pixel,'voltageSwing',1.5);

% Re-attach the pixel to the sensor
dut = sensorSet(dut,'pixel',pixel);

% Now you can display the device under test in the window.  Note that the
% description in the window matches the parameters you set above.
%
val = vcAddAndSelectObject('sensor',dut); sensorImageWindow;

% You can also set using additional scripting or through the window
% interface.  If you then wish to save the sensor, you can do so from the
% window (File | Save Sensor (ISA))
%
% or by just saving it from the command window by typing
% dut = vcGetObject('sensor'); objFullFileName = vcExportObject(dut);

%% You only need to create the sensor profile (as above) once.  After it is
% saved, you can always load the stored image sensor array description.
% dut = load(objFullFileName);
% Then, to examine voltage data you just read a file that contains the 
% variable 'volts'.  These are stored in the structure, and the window is
% refreshed. For example, I stored some data in this file.

fullName = 'dutData.mat';
tmp = load(fullName,'volts');
dut = sensorSet(dut,'volts',tmp.volts);

vcReplaceObject(dut,val); sensorImageWindow;

%
% To experiment with different imaging pipelines from the sensor data to
% display, you write a routine modeled after the code in myRender
% [isetRootPath,'\ISET-algorithms\Processing\Render\myRender.m']
